# obsidian-mermaid-plus
Plugin for Obsidan that enchances the capacities of the Mermaid diagrams.
You can add width or height in a custom code block called `mermaid-plus`
Example:
```mermaid-plus
width:500%,
height:200%,
diagram:

    title My working day
    section Go to work
      Make tea: 5: Me
      Go upstairs: 3: Me
      Do work: 1: Me, Cat
      Make tea: 5: Me
      Go upstairs: 3: Me
      Do work: 1: Me, Cat
      Make tea: 5: Me
      Go upstairs: 3: Me

      Do work: 1: Me, Cat
    section Go home
      Go downstairs: 5: Me
      Sit down: 5: Me
```

You can also set one of the default Mermaid themes for all the diagrams.
